## Recipe search box

**What it does in-game:** Adds a text box above the recipe list at every crafting station, and on the inventory's own crafting panel. Typing filters the list as you type. It matches the recipe name, the category name (e.g. "armor") and, optionally, ingredient names (e.g. "silver" shows everything made with silver). While a search is active, every category is expanded so no match is hidden.

**How to use it:** Click the box and type. Clear it to see the full list again. While the box has focus, keys go only to the box, so WASD, E, Tab and the hotbar keys don't act in the game. Click elsewhere, or press Enter or Esc, to give keys back to the game.

**Config settings:**

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ShowSearchBar` | `true` | Show the search box. Requires a restart. |
| `SearchIngredients` | `true` | Also match ingredient names. |
| `ClearSearchOnClose` | `true` | Clear the search when the inventory closes. |

**Known issues:**
- The box goes in space taken from the top of the recipe list. Its position is worked out from the game's layout at runtime, so it may be misaligned at some resolutions or UI scales. This is the most likely thing to need fixing after the first play-test.
- If the recipe list's scroll view can't be found (e.g. another mod rebuilt that UI), the box isn't created. A warning is logged, and grouping still works.

**Vanilla behaviour overridden (Harmony patch targets):**

| Target | Patch | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `InventoryGui.Show` | Postfix | Creates the search bar the first time the inventory opens. Also shrinks the recipe list's scroll view (and its scrollbar) from the top to make room. |
| `InventoryGui.Hide` | Postfix | Clears the search if `ClearSearchOnClose` is on. |
| `InventoryGui.UpdateRecipeList` | Postfix | Removes non-matching recipes from the list. Shared with the categories feature. |

Also uses Jötunn's `GUIManager.BlockInput` while the box has focus. Any mod that also resizes or rebuilds the crafting panel's recipe list may conflict with the layout change.

## Collapsible recipe categories

**What it does in-game:** Splits the recipe list into categories under headers you can click. Each header shows its open/closed state and how many recipes in it you can craft right now, e.g. `[-] Armor (3/11)`. Inside each category, the game's own sort order is kept, so craftable recipes still come first.

Grouping modes:
- **By type:** Melee Weapons, Bows & Crossbows, Magic, Ammo, Shields, Armor, Tools, Utility & Trinkets, Food & Potions, Materials, Other. Pickaxes and fishing rods count as Tools; staffs count as Magic.
- **By biome:** Meadows, Black Forest, Swamp, Mountain, Plains, Mistlands, Ashlands, Deep North, Other. A recipe goes under the latest biome of any of its ingredients.
- **No groups:** the vanilla flat list.

**How to use it:** Click a header to collapse or expand it. The button to the right of the search box cycles By type → By biome → No groups; the choice is saved to the config. Works in both the Craft and Upgrade tabs.

**Config settings:**

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Grouping` | `ItemType` | `None`, `ItemType` or `Biome`. |
| `StartCollapsed` | `false` | Start each session with every category collapsed. |
| `BiomeMaterialOverrides` | *(empty)* | Extra `PrefabName:Biome` pairs, comma separated, e.g. `MyModOre:Mountain`. |

**Known issues:**
- Biome grouping uses a hand-written list of vanilla material prefab names. It has no Deep North materials yet, so 1.0's Deep North recipes will probably show under Ashlands until they're added to the list or to `BiomeMaterialOverrides`. Some prefab names in the list may also be wrong.
- Which categories are collapsed is remembered only until the game closes.
- Collapsing the category that holds the selected recipe moves the selection to the first visible recipe.
- Category labels are English only.

**Vanilla behaviour overridden (Harmony patch targets):**

| Target | Patch | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `InventoryGui.UpdateRecipeList` | Postfix | Regroups and repositions the recipe rows, inserts header rows, and drops the rows of collapsed categories from `m_availableRecipes` so the selection and gamepad navigation only see visible recipes. Also resizes the list. |
| `InventoryGui.Awake` | Postfix | Resets header and category caches on each world load. |

Any mod that also re-sorts or re-lays out `InventoryGui.m_availableRecipes` or the recipe rows will likely conflict.

## Craft and build from nearby chests

**What it does in-game:** Materials in chests near the crafting station count toward recipe requirements (the ingredient counts and whether a recipe can be crafted), and are used when you craft. Your own inventory is used first, then the closest chests. Optionally the same applies to building with the hammer, hoe and cultivator; then chests near you are used instead of chests near a station.

Chests are skipped when:
- they're another player's private chest;
- they're inside a ward you don't have access to;
- someone else has them open;
- they're listed in `ExcludedContainers`.

Ship and cart storage and tombstones are never used. Taking from a ship or cart would make you its network owner, which disrupts whoever is sailing or pulling it.

**How to use it:** Just craft or build near your chests. Nothing to click.

**Config settings** (admin-only: when the mod is on a server, the server's values apply to everyone):

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Enabled` | `true` | Use materials from nearby containers. |
| `Range` | `20` | Search radius in metres (1–100), around the crafting station, or around you when building. |
| `UseForBuilding` | `true` | Also use containers when building. |
| `ExcludedContainers` | *(empty)* | Comma separated container prefab names never to use, e.g. `piece_chest_private`. |

**Known issues:**
- If two players take from the same chest at the same moment, the last save wins and one of them may keep or lose items incorrectly. Valheim Plus's version has the same race.
- Recipes that accept any one of several ingredients don't use chest contents. The game picks the item from your inventory directly, so chest stock isn't shown for them either.
- Chest contents are re-checked every 0.5 s, so a chest someone just changed may be briefly out of date in the counts.

**Vanilla behaviour overridden (Harmony patch targets):**

| Target | Patch | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `Inventory.CountItems(string, int, bool)` | Postfix | Adds nearby chest stock to the player inventory's count, only inside the crafting/building code paths below. |
| `Inventory.RemoveItem(string, int, int, bool)` | Prefix (changes `amount`) | When paying a cost, takes the shortfall from nearby chests, then lets vanilla remove the rest from the player. |
| `InventoryGui.UpdateCraftingPanel`, `InventoryGui.UpdateRecipe`, `InventoryGui.DoCrafting` | Prefix + Finalizer | Mark "crafting in progress" so the two inventory patches apply. |
| `Player.UpdatePlacement`, `Hud.UpdatePieceBuildStatus`, `Hud.UpdatePieceBuildStatusAll`, `Hud.SetupPieceInfo` | Prefix + Finalizer | Mark "building in progress" (when `UseForBuilding` is on). |
| `Player.HaveRequirementItems` | Prefix + Finalizer | Turns chest counting off for any-one-ingredient recipes. |
| `Container.Awake` | Postfix | Tracks every container so nearby ones can be found without physics queries. |

**Conflicts:** Valheim Plus (and mods like Craft From Containers or AzuCraftyBoxes) have their own craft-from-chests features. If one of those is also on, chest contents may be counted twice, and crafting can fail or take the wrong amounts. Use only one: turn off either this feature (`Enabled = false`) or the other mod's.

## Loot system

**Status:** Planned. Not started.

**Ideas so far:**
- Rarity tiers for dropped gear, with randomly rolled bonus stats.
- Stats stored on the item (`ItemDrop.ItemData.m_customData`), shown in tooltips and synced in multiplayer.
- Likely patch points: `CharacterDrop` / `DropTable` for drops, and item tooltips.

Epic Loot already does a lot of this, so the design should be checked against it before starting.

## Combat mechanics

**Status:** Planned. Not started.

**Ideas so far:**
- Perfect-parry timing windows, combos, a posture/stagger bar, dodge i-frames and weapon special moves.
- Likely patch points: `Humanoid`, `Attack`, `Character.Damage`.
- New animations would need asset-bundle work in the `JotunnModUnity` project.
